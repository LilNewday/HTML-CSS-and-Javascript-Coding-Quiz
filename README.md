# HTML CSS and Javascript Coding Quiz

## Description

I needed to test my knowledge on some of the basic know-how's of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and figured this would be a fun way to do it. With an overwhelming amount of knowledge and information I was constantly learning in these areas I thought a nice warm up could benefit my retention of all these skills and allow me to reflect on the progress i've made. It's simple now, but maybe in the future i'll expand on it some more to keep me on my toes. I learned a lot making this quiz and I think one of my biggest deals was proper file management and linkage. After that it was dealing with DOM elements and FREAKING localStorage!! On the plus side after that everything else wasn't as bad and I got a nice reminder that it's hard to manipulate a timer when you introduce it in a function instead of outside as a variable at least.
